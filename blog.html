              Recently I was admitted into Hack Reactor’s Remote Program which is a life changing 12-week coding immersion program. During the first week or so we focused on learning more about scopes, closures, the keyword ‘this’, class instantiation patterns, time complexity, prototype chains and data structures. I found much of it fascinating and exciting, however knowing that further understanding of this content was paramount to my continued growth, I powered forward.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Previously I had seen the keyword ‘this’ while building constructor functions when completing the JavaScript track in Code Academy. At the time, it was quite confusing so I reached out to my coding buddy enquiring about its mystical powers. He mentioned that the keyword ‘this’ contains a lot of ‘gotchas’ and made the point that it would only become clearer with further study and practice.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Now that I am into my third week at Hack Reactor Remote, I know that the keyword ‘this’ is an auto-bound identifier intended to refer to an object during method or constructor function invocation. I also learned that there are five ways that the keyword ‘this’ can appear in your running code.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              What helped was knowing that the first and most common way to use the keyword this is during method invocation where this is bound to the object that was left of the “call time dot”.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              The second and third ways to use the keyword this are inside the call and apply methods. The object passed into the first argument of their parameter list is what the keyword this is bound to.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              The fourth and fifth binding patterns for the keyword ‘this’ are not useful as they bind themselves to the global object in the browser window. Examples would be when the keyword this is used in the global scope or when it is used in a free function invocation. Thank you for reading my post.
